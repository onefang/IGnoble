Use this to create a sim that links into Infinite Grid from Linux.

I'ts been tested on Ubuntu 10.04, YMMV.

Follow these steps.

Go to -

http://wiki.infinitegrid.org/index.php/Howto_Link_your_Opensim_region_to_Infinite_Grid

and follow the directions to create an admin user account.  You can skip
that bit if you already have a suitable user with sudo access.

Note that these scripts pretty much follow that above wiki description,
with some exceptions.  REST is used for console access, instead of
screen.  The configuration information per sim has been rearranged so
that there is only ONE copy of the OpenSim installation.

Next you need to figure out what password you want to use for OpenSims
access to the database.  We will call this "DatabasePassword".  Run the
following script -

./install_opensim.sh DatabasePassword

This will do most of the work fo you, except for creating sims.  A
separate script is here for sim creation, you can use it to create many
sims.  You will need -

Your host name, or it could be your IP, we will use "sims.example.net".

A name for your sim, we will use "My new sim".  It should be unique on
the grid.

A location for your sim, we will use "1234,5678".  You can use the
Infinite Grid web based map to poke around and find a good location. 
Choose an empty spot.

Optionally, you might need your IP address if you are creating more than
one sim, we will use "1.2.3.4".

Once you have all that information sorted out, run this script if ONLY
hosting a single sim on this computer -

./create_sim.sh "My new sim" "1234,5678" "sims.example.net"

Or this if you plan on running more than one sim -

./create_sim.sh "My new sim" "1234,5678" "sims.example.net" "1.2.3.4"

Now you can go to /opt/opensim/config/sim01 and run the following script
to start it up -

./start-sim-in-rest

You will see the REST console.  You can run the REST console again by
running that command once more.

Once it's all tested, you can use this to finish things off (back in
this directory) -

./go_live.sh

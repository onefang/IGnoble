FIX BUGS -

Hmmmm, monit has trouble restarting the sim after a reboot, and seems
unreliable sometimes.  Scan through monits conf.d directory, look at the
sim links, follow those to the sims config directory, then run start-sim
from there. Then stick that code at the end of fix_var_run.sh, since
it's running from rc.local anyway.


NEW FEATURES -

In [Startup] there is this -
    ; To run a script every few minutes, set the script filename here
    ; timer_Script = "filename"
Could do things with that perhaps.


In [Startup] there is this -
    ; Simulator Stats URI
    ; Enable JSON simulator data by setting a URI name (case sensitive)
    ; Stats_URI = "jsonSimStats"
